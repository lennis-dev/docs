# Create a new documentation

To create a new documentation you need to do the following steps:

1. Create a new directory in the `docs` directory with the name of your documentation *(e.g. `my-documentation`)*.
2. Create a new directory in the directory created in the previous step with the name of the version of your documentation *(e.g. `v1`)*.
3. Create a new index file in the version directory created in the previous step named `index.md`.
4. Write the content of your documentation in the index file created in the previous step.
5. Create a sidebar file in the version directory created in the second step named `data.json` and wirte something like [this](./create-sidebar).
